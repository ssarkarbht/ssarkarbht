## Summary of the Pattern Recognition Problem in Neutrino Trident Research Project

One of the major event topologies in the IceCube detector is called "track-like" event, generated by the Cherenkov radiation (bluish light) from high energy muon passing through the detector volume. More than 5000 embedded light sensors the detector called digital optical modules (DOM) detect the light from the Cherenkov radiation and register timestamps and amount of light seen in the form of charges.
